How do I create / edit files on Secretariat?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend using a text editor like `nano`_ or `vim`_ for quickly editing file content on Secretariat. Please follow the links for cheatsheets of useful commands for each.

You may also run the command ``touch [filename].sh`` if you would like to create an empty file called *[filename].sh* in your current directory. After this, you may use your text editor of choice to add / amend the content of the file.
