VPN
###

Any time that you are using an internet connection other than the Clemson network, you will need to connect to it remotely to access resources such as Secretariat or university-licensed journals.

Setup
-----

`Clemson Computing & Information Technology (CCIT)`_ has written `instructions`_ on how to connect to the Clemson University Virtual Private Network (CUVPN). The steps can be summarized in the following manner:

1. **Duo Enrollment**_: You will need to register for Duo two factor authentication if you have not already so that you can make a secure remote connection.

2. `**Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client**`_: This is the software that you will use to make the remote connection. You should be prompted to download and install while following the CCIT instructions.

3. **Connect**: Now you have all the pieces you need to connect! The CCIT instructions detail how to launch the client and how to enter information to connect.

Especially for first-time users, some of the steps of using the VPN to make a remote connection may be unclear, particularly with respect to the two factor authentication step. We hope to clarify some of the common hangups below.

* Make sure that your secondary device (*e.g.* cell phone) is near you when initiating your VPN connection. If you do not complete the authentication step in a timely manner, you will need to restart the VPN connection process.

* After launching the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client, entering the appropriate address (cuvpn.clemson.edu), and clicking "connect," a login box will appear. Once you have typed in your username and password, you will also need to select one of the listed options for the "Duo Passcode" section.

   * If you choose the first option (*i.e.* Type your One-Time Passcode), you will need to navigate to the Duo Mobile app on your secondary device, select the drop-down arrow beside "Clemson University," type the six digit numeric code that should be listed, and click "OK."

   * If you choose the second option (*i.e.* Type "push" to get a Duo Mobile app prompt), you will need to type the word "push" (no quotes) into the box and click "OK."
