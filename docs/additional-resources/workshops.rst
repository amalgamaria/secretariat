You will find information about currently-offered CHG Bioinformatics and Statistics Laboratory (BSL) workshops below.

HPCC Basics Workshop
--------------------

**Frequency**: Fall (~September) and Spring (~February) semesters.

**Location**: CHG, Greenwood, SC (remote option possible).

The High Performance Cluster Computing (HPCC) Basics workshop is divided into 3 parts, so you must attend all 3 sessions! It is recommended that all Secretariat users attend this workshop. Note that this workshop does not give an introduction to Linux. Before attending, make sure that you know a few command line basics and feel comfortable navigating around a virtual computing environment using commands (e.g. `those mentioned in this tutorial`_).

**Tags**: Cluster resources, Login, Workspace navigation, Permissions, Data transfer, Software accession, Software installation, Job submission, Cluster etiquette.

**Day 1**: Users will learn about Secretariat's architecture (partitions, nodes, cores, RAM) so that they can request appropriate resources for their analyses. Instructors will ensure that users can log into the cluster from the command line. Users will learn how to gather user-specific information from the command line prompt and how to use basic Unix commands to navigate around the directory structure. Instructors will advise users on where to store / access different types of data. Users will learn about the significance of file / directory permissions (read, write, execute) and how to be intentional about setting permissions for different purposes.

**Day 2**: Users will practice transferring data between local (laptop) and remote (Secretariat) machines using command line and graphical user interface methods. Instructors will emphasize the importance of maintaining a data backup plan. Instructors will explain how to access software via a module system, how to list currently available modularized software, and when it is necessary to load software. Users will also learn how to install software when it is not already installed on the cluster through a variety of methods and how to create a module file from software installed from source.

**Day 3**: Instructors will give recommendations on how to organize a project directory before beginning an analysis. Instructors will explain how Slurm handles job submissions, will walk users through the general layout of an SBATCH script, and demonstrate several Slurm commands (squeue, sbatch, srun, sinfo, scontrol, scancel). Users will learn how to create interactive sessions and instructors will demonstrate how to estimate cluster resources needed for a job by scaling down the analysis, and monitoring it in real time and / or afterwards, and looking at stats that Slurm collects. Instructors will demonstrate how to connect to Secretariat via Open OnDemand (https://secretariat-master) and give a tour of the interface.
