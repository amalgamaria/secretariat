Clemson University VPN
######################

Any time that you are using an internet connection other than the Clemson network, you will need to connect to it remotely. CCIT has written `instructions`_ on how to connect to the Clemson University Virtual Private Network (CUVPN).

The steps can be summarized in the following manner:

1. `Duo Enrollment`_: You will need to register for Duo two factor authentication if you have not already so that you can make a secure remote connection.

2. `Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client`_: This is the software that you will use to make the remote connection. You should be prompted to download and install while following the CCIT instructions.

3. Connect: Now you have all the pieces you need to connect! The CCIT instructions detail how to launch the client and how to enter information to connect.
